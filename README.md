Video recorder that can be shot on the webcam on the spot!

This program allows you to record videos on a laptop or computer webcam on a very simple and spontaneous basis. You can start/stop the recording by pressing space key after you see if you look good with the preview(a red circle will be displayed during the recording). Press T to turn the camera left and right to find a better angle. When you are done filming, you can press the ESC key to exit.
